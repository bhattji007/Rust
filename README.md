# Rust Learning Repository

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! ðŸ¦€ Here, I document my daily progress and learning from the book "The Rust Programming Language" by the Brown University CS Department.

## Overview

This repository serves as a public record of my journey as I delve into the Rust programming language. Each day, I commit my learnings, code snippets, challenges, and breakthroughs to showcase my progress.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamental concepts of Rust
- Gain practical experience through coding exercises and projects
- Build a strong foundation for developing robust, safe, and efficient software in Rust


## Code Examples

You can find Rust code examples organized by chapters in the [practice-snippets](practice/) directory. Each example showcases a particular concept or feature discussed in the book.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository, review my code, and provide feedback or suggestions. If you're also learning Rust, I'd love to connect and share experiences!
