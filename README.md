# Rust Learning Repository

Welcome to my Rust learning repository! ðŸ¦€ Here, I document my daily progress and learning from the book "The Rust Programming Language" by the Brown University CS Department.

## Overview

This repository serves as a public record of my journey as I delve into the Rust programming language. Each day, I commit my learnings, code snippets, challenges, and breakthroughs to showcase my progress.

## Goals

- Learn the fundamental concepts of Rust
- Gain practical experience through coding exercises and projects
- Build a strong foundation for developing robust, safe, and efficient software in Rust

## Progress Tracking

- **[Day 1](day1/)**: Introduction to Rust, setting up the development environment, Getting Started 
- **[Day 2](day2/)**: Exploring Rust syntax and basic data types, Guessing game, Common Programming Concepts.
- ...

## Learning Journal

For a detailed account of my journey, challenges, and discoveries, check out my [Learning Journal](learning_journal.md).

## Code Examples

You can find Rust code examples organized by chapters in the [code-examples](code-examples/) directory. Each example showcases a particular concept or feature discussed in the book.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the repository, review my code, and provide feedback or suggestions. If you're also learning Rust, I'd love to connect and share experiences!
